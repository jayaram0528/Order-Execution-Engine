# 🚀 Order Execution Engine

A **high‑performance decentralized exchange (DEX) order execution and routing engine** designed to demonstrate how real‑world trading systems work under the hood — fast, reliable, and observable in real time.

This project emphasizes **clean architecture**, **production‑ready backend patterns**, and **excellent developer experience**, while keeping the system easy to read, reason about, and extend.

## ✨ What This Project Does (At a Glance)

* Accepts trade requests (e.g., **SOL → USDC**)
* Compares prices across multiple DEXs (Raydium & Meteora)
* Automatically selects the **best execution price**
* Executes orders asynchronously using a queue‑based worker model
* Streams **real‑time order status updates** to clients via WebSockets

All of this is implemented as a **type‑safe, well‑tested, and scalable backend system** suitable for real production environments.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔀 Smart DEX Routing

Automatically compares prices from **Raydium** and **Meteora** and routes each order to the DEX offering the best execution price.

### 📡 Real‑Time Order Updates

Clients receive **live order status updates** (pending → executing → completed) using WebSockets, enabling reactive UIs and monitoring tools.

### 🧵 Queue‑Based Order Processing

Uses **BullMQ + Redis** to safely process concurrent orders, handle retries, and decouple API requests from execution logic.

### 🔁 Reliable Error Handling

Built‑in **automatic retries with exponential backoff**:

* 2 seconds → 4 seconds → 8 seconds

This ensures resilience against temporary failures and external service instability.

### 🧠 Type‑Safe by Design

Written entirely in **TypeScript**, reducing runtime errors and improving long‑term maintainability.

### 🧪 Production‑Grade Testing

* **96 tests passing**
* **91.79% overall coverage**

This is not a toy project — it follows real production quality standards.

## 💡 Order Type Choice: Market Orders

### Why Market Orders?

For this implementation, I intentionally started with **Market Orders**.

**Rationale:**

1. **Focus on Core Architecture**
   Market orders execute immediately, making them ideal for demonstrating the complete execution pipeline — routing, queuing, execution, persistence, and WebSocket updates — without additional complexity.

2. **Predictable & Testable Behavior**
   Immediate execution results in deterministic outcomes, simpler test cases, and fewer edge conditions compared to conditional orders.

3. **Production‑Realistic**
   Market orders are the most common order type and form the foundation of most trading systems.

---

## 🔌 Extending to Other Order Types

The system is **designed for extensibility**. Only the *trigger mechanism* changes — the core execution pipeline remains untouched.

### 📈 Limit Orders

* Add a background worker that periodically polls DEX prices (every N seconds)
* When the target price is reached, trigger the existing `processOrder()` flow

No changes are required to:

* Queue system
* DEX router
* WebSocket updates
* Retry logic

### 🎯 Sniper Orders (Token Launch Trades)

* Subscribe to Raydium/Meteora pool‑creation events via WebSockets
* On token launch detection:

  * Immediately enqueue the order with **high priority**
  * Apply higher slippage tolerance to account for launch volatility

### ✅ Shared Across All Order Types

* DEX routing logic
* BullMQ queue
* WebSocket infrastructure
* Retry & error handling
* Database layer

```json
{
  "tokenIn": "SOL",
  "tokenOut": "USDC",
  "amount": 10,
  "slippage": 0.01
}
```

**Response (202 – Accepted):**

```json
{
  "orderId": "order_1768048336478_y769la",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Order created and queued successfully"
}
```

---

### ▶️ Get Order Status

**GET** `/api/orders/:orderId`

```json
{
  "id": "order_123",
  "tokenIn": "SOL",
  "tokenOut": "USDC",
  "amount": 10,
  "status": "completed",
  "selectedDex": "RAYDIUM",
  "executedPrice": 2024.50
}
```

---

### ▶️ List All Orders

**GET** `/api/orders`

---

## 🔌 WebSocket Streaming

Subscribe to real‑time updates for a specific order:

```js
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws/order_123');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(update);
};
```

---

## 📬 Postman Collection

A ready‑to‑use **Postman collection** is included in this repository for easy API testing and validation.

### What’s Included

The `postman_collection.json` file contains pre‑configured requests:

* Health Check — verify the API is running
* Create Market Order — submit a new order
* Get Order by ID — retrieve order details
* List All Orders — fetch order history
* Invalid Order Test — validate error handling

### How to Use

#### Option 1: Postman UI

1. Open Postman (Desktop or Web)
2. Click **Import**
3. Select `postman_collection.json`
4. Set environment variable `baseUrl`:

   * Local: `http://localhost:3000`
   * Production: `https://order-execution-engine-production-c76b.up.railway.app`
5. Send requests and observe responses

#### Option 2: Newman (CLI)

```bash
# Install Newman
npm install -g newman

# Run against local API
newman run postman_collection.json --env-var "baseUrl=http://localhost:3000"

# Run against production
newman run postman_collection.json --env-var "baseUrl=https://order-execution-engine-production-c76b.up.railway.app"
```
